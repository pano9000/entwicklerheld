# Personal Data Safety

My solution for the ['Personal Data Safety' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/personal-data-safety?technology=PHP) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Goal is to create a function that gets the personal data of a given `user_id`, and returns it either masked, or unmasked, depending on status of authentication.

## Comment
Challenge was not in Javascript, but PHP, but I gave it a shot anyways. I'm not a PHP guy, so the solution might be clumsy.
