# Maps and Polygons

My solution for the ['Maps and Polygons' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/maps-and-polygons?technology=Java) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Challenge consists of two scenarios:

1) Was to calculate the area of a given (irregular) polygon

2) Placing a label on a map for each of the given polygons - following certain rules, like e.g. the label not being allowed to touch the polygon and not being allowed to be "outside" of the map

## Comment
Interesting challenge for me, as I did not really pay any attention during my Maths classes :-).

The first scenario was nevertheless easily solved after finding out about the `Shoelace Algorithm/Formula`, which I just needed to turn into Java code.

The second scenario was the more challenging one, as it involved finding a way to detect "collisions" between the label and the polygon and the map borders.
