# Reverse SMS

My solution for the ['Reverse SMS' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/reverse-sms?technology=JavaScript) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Challenge consists of essentially creating a function to reverse provided text and counting the palindromes inside that text, and using the Twilio client to "send" that info as SMS. Second part was to implement a function that is run, when Twilio calls a webhook, that reverses and then sends the received information from the webhook.
