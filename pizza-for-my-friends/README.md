# Pizza for my Friends Challenge

My solution for the ['Pizza for my Friends Challenge' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/pizza-for-my-friends-challenge?technology=JavaScript) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Goal of the challenge was to create two functions: One that matches a list of pizzas with different toppings against a list of persons with certain likes/dislikes.

The other function was essentially the same, but the other way around: Matching a list of persons against a pizza's different toppings, to determine, which persons might like that particular pizza.

## Comment
This was promoted as a "JavaScript (React)" challenge, but the React part of the challenge was tiny, the more interesting part was the friends/pizza/toppings matching part, which was easily done.

I only had a hard time trying to refactor the first non-DRY solution, but I did manage in the end.
