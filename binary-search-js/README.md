# Binary Search

My solution for the ['Binary Search' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/binary-search?technology=JavaScript) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Challenge consisted of writing a binary search function that also keeps track of how many 'steps' (or 'iterations') it took to get to the result.

## Comment
I opted to go with an iterative solution, that works 'in place' and without copying any array data, but instead works with index ranges for the 'divide and conquer' part :-)
