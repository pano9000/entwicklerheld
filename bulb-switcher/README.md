# Bulb Switcher

My solution for the ['Bulb Switcher' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/bulb-switcher?technology=Java) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
You are given an integer n representing the number of bulbs. All bulbs are initially off.
In each round i (from 1 to n), toggle all bulbs whose position is divisible by i.
Return the final bulb configuration as a string of 0s and 1s, where 1 means the bulb is on and 0 means it is off.
