# Perfect Place

My solution for the ['Perfect Place' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/perfect-place?technology=javascript) on the [Entwicklerheld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

Description
---
Goal here was to find the optimal places to place a varying amount of "ATMs" within a given `Region`, with multiple `Citys`. The idea is to distribute the ATMs in the Region's Cities in a way which will make sure that the distances between a city and an ATM are kept to a minimum.
