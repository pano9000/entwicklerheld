# State Machine (Java)

My solution for the ['State Machine' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/state-machine?technology=java) on the [Entwicklerheld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

Description
---
Goal was to implement a simple "State Machine" that checks the next allowed transitions from state to state. The second part included implementing an IBAN checksum checker, that was used to then control, if the transition to the next state was allowed.
