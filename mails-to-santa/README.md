# Mails to Santa

My solution for the ['Mails to Santa' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/mails-to-santa?technology=PHP) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Goal is to create a function that checks if a given email is received within predefined business hours/days. If that is not the case the function should return the next "possible" delivery date (i.e. the next business hours).
