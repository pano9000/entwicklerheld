# Mails to Santa

My solution for the ['Mails to Santa' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/mails-to-santa?technology=php) on the [Entwicklerheld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

Description
---
Goal is to create a function that checks if a given email is received within predefined business hours/days. If that is not the case the function should return the next "possible" delivery date (i.e. the next business hours).

Challenge was not in Javascript, but PHP, but I gave it a shot anyways. I'm not a PHP guy, so the solution might be clumsy.
