# Rest API

My solution for the ['Rest API' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/rest-api?technology=Java) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Challenge consisted of creating a 'REST' API that handles the different HTTP methods, like `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.

## Comment
Having worked with Node.js/Express.js on a few REST-like APIs before, I was used to a certain workflow there, that I was not able to replicate here, due to the constraints of needing to have everything in one class. In a real world example, this would ideally be split into e.g. a routing part, a controller part and a validation step.

It was also a bit interesting to see, how to handle JSON data outside of JavaScript.

Anyways my Java solution can be found in the 'IOUApi.java' file.
