My solution for the ['Bowling' Challenge](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/challenge/bowling?technology=JavaScript) on the [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de/) Code Challenge Platform.

## Description
Challenge consisted basically of creating a Bowling Score Counter, that keeps track of the knocked off pins and returns a total score at the end.
